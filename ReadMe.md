Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.  

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

Project Summary
===============
The following is a summary description of the project instructions  

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.  

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Files
=====
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.  

<mark>CodeBook.md</mark> describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.  

<mark>run_analysis.R</mark> contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.  

The output of the 5th step is called <mark>tidydata.txt</mark>, and uploaded in the course project's form.
